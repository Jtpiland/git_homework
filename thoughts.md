Takeaways:
- Planning and calendaring are going to be very important to my success in this program.
- Previous experience, no matter what industry, can be drawn on when it comes to coding, specifically the problem solving aspect of it.


Strategies:
- Focus on how to learn again by constantly reviewing previous material. Rote memorization.
- Come at every task openly, the frustration of trying to figure it out is the learning process.

Shoutout:
- Too many for just one!
  * Shoutout to my boss for being very understanding and flexible during my first week of this new journey!
  * Special shoutout to my partner who has been so great helping take on more than her share of the responsibility in taking care of our 4.5 month old puppy "Clifton"


I'm adding more thoughts here.
